Website Designed by: Thumber Jaiwin (j_thumber158050)

Design Principles: 
	-> Contrast: The theme which I have created is based on the food item on which it suits the best. The contrast of food and theme is better as it looks proper with the images.
	-> Balance: The website color, images and text are balanced as it is not getting too dull or to bright. The theme looks decent as the color mataches the images.
	-> Emphasis: The image section are emphasied than other section as it is the main attraction for the people, as now a days people are more like to stay on website on basis of images.
	-> Proportion: Content in the website are proprtionated as there sections which needed to be highlighted and some sections needed to be normal or that section doesn't need any attraction like description.
	-> Hierarchy: The heirarchy og the website is top to bootm i.e., important section to least important section.
	-> Rhythm: The animation in the section are in rythm which will curious the viewer to chech the next content.
	-> Variety: There is many thing in the website which will creates visual interest in the design like typography, images, animation, etc.
	

Strategies used to improve websiteâ€™s accessibility compliance:
	To improve accessiblity I have used limited animation which easily run on server and it will not create any adverse effect on it to load the content. 
	The other strategy was to provide the informative data on website which will prevent the design from becoming boring and monotonous.

Search engine optimization:
	For search engine optimization I have included the keyword which are used in website and are related to it. The title and content of the website is similar to the keywords of the seo content so that no other content search will show the result.
